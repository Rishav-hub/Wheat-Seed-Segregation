## 🍞 Wheat Seed Segregation
Wheat segregation is a very important task in agricultural domain for many industry using wheat as row material for making different products. Here in this project we have used a dataset which contains seven variables for three distinct types of wheat kernels: (Kama, Rosa, Canadian) designated as numerical variables 1, 2 & 3 respectively. The seven seed variables are:

- Area
- Perimeter
- Compactness
- Kernel Length
- Kernel Width
- Asymmetry Coefficient
- Kernel Groove Length
